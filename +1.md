# Longest Common Increasing Subsequence (LCIS)

## Problem Statement

Given two arrays `a[]` and `b[]`, find the length of the **Longest Common Increasing Subsequence (LCIS)**.

**LCIS** refers to a subsequence that:
- Appears in both arrays
- Is strictly increasing

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
a = [3, 4, 9, 1]  
b = [5, 3, 8, 9, 10, 2, 1]

**Output:**  
2

**Explanation:**  
The LCIS is **[3, 9]**, whose length is 2.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
a = [1, 1, 4, 3]  
b = [1, 1, 3, 4]

**Output:**  
2

**Explanation:**  
Possible LCIS: **[1, 3]** or **[1, 4]**

---

## Python Implementation

```python
def LCIS(self, a, b):
    # code here
    l = [0] * len(b)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        k = 0
        for j in range(len(b)):
            if a[i] == b[j]:
                l[j] = k + 1
            elif b[j] < a[i]:
                k = max(k, l[j])
    return max(l)
